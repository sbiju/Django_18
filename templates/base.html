In the video above, Narayana Murthy demonstrates how he harvests bark from living trees to make free herbal medicine for indigent patients with severe illnesses.

By Narayana Murthy, we don't mean the IT czar from Bangalore, but a lesser-known person from the same state of Karnataka in India. Known as Vaidya Narayana Murthy, he gives out herbal medicines weekly to thousands of patients ailing from different diseases, from kidney stones to heart disease to different kinds of cancer.

Narayana Murthy, about 60 years of age, is from a small village called Narasipura, about 50 km from Shimoga in Karnataka. A Brahmin farmer, he carries on the age-old tradition of Ayurvedic herbal medicine with the help of some NGOs. Every Sunday and Thursday, early in the morning, people from all over Southern India and elsewhere in the world queue up in front of his house. With the help of his family and aides, Murthy serves his patients. On these days, he treats around 600 to 700 patients troubled by different diseases.

Murthy listens intently to each patient for a minute or two, looks briefly at any lab reports they bring, and dispenses medicine, for 15 to 30 days depending on the ailment, free of cost. The patient needs to take these medicines with specific dietary instructions. It is not mandatory for the patient to come themselves to collect the medicine; relatives or friends can also collect the medicine fortnightly or monthly by bringing lab reports or information on symptoms of the illness.

The source of Murthy’s medicines is primarily plants and herbs—stems, roots, and bark—which he personally collects from the forest during particular days of the week.

Narayana Murthy is the last ray of hope for many terminally ill patients suffering from cancer, heart diseases, and respiratory problems. His expertise in treating cancer, kidney stones, and heart block has left many astonished. Just a day’s worth of medicine has yielded unbelievable results for heart blocks and kidney stones.

His treatment for certain kinds of cancer has yielded excellent results, although he recommends these patients take the treatment for six to eight months.

There are as many as 15 NGOs working with Murthy in this noble cause. It has been more than 25 years Murthy started serving the people. He has never expected anything in return, and he has never sought any attention or publicity.

In the age of globalization, which has a costly allopathic treatment for every disease, the common man can't afford mainstream treatments for diseases like cancer and coronary artery disease. Thus, it's highly commendable that someone is helping thousands of people without any expectation of payment. As Murthy tells actress Caroline Quentin in the video above, his medicines do help many people, and to others they at least give hope.

You can reach Shimoga from Bangalore, about 280 km via bus or train. From Shimoga, you can reach Narasipura by public or private transport.

No appointment is required to see Murthy. Service is provided on a first-come-first-served basis, starting at 7 AM every Sunday and Thursday.

Mr. Murthy can be reached by phone, but he is a very busy person serving hundreds of patients, so it is not fair to expect him to call anyone back.

  <h2 class="featurette-heading">And lastly, this one. <span class="text-muted">Lakshmitaru.</span></h2>
  <p class="lead">Simarouba glauca has a long history in herbal medicine in many countries including Cuba, Brazil, Mexico, Peru etc. It is taken internally for diarrhea, dysentery, malaria and colitis and used externally for wounds and sores. In Brazilian herbal medicine, Simarouba bark has long been the most highly recommended (and most effective) natural remedy against chronic and acute dysentery. Caceres et al. (1990) and Lidia et al. (1991),reported that the extract of

S .glauca have been used in Guatemala for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders. In Cuba, an infusion of the leaves or bark is considered to be astringent, a digestion and menstrual stimulant and an antiparasitic remedy.  The chemicals present in leaf, fruit pulp and seed are known to possess the medicinal properties such as amoebicide, analgesic, anthelmintic, antibacterial, antidysenteric, antileukemic, antimalarial, antimicrobial, antitumorous, antiviral, astringent, cytotoxic, emmenagogue, febrifuge, skin hydrator, stomachic, sudorific, tonic, vermifuge. Several studies published in 1970’s and late 90’s reported that extracts from Simarouba possessed antileukemic and antitumorous activities. An article titled ‘A tree of solace for cancer patients’ published in ‘The New Indian Express’ on 18th January, 2013 reports personal experience of many people who were using decoction of Lakshmitaru leaves got cured from cancer/tumor and recovered from side effects of chemotherapy .

Traditional preparation of Lakshmitaru decoctions:
